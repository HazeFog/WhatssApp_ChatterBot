# WhatssApp_ChatterBot
Hello everyone!
This is my project for a chatterbot for Whatsapp.
His name is James, and I'm trying to improve his functionalities

#Quick start:

Step 1- download the project and extract it

Step 2- substitute the "[Name of the contact]" in the "main.py" with the name of the person that you want to use with. (it needs to be exatly how it is on your whatsapp)

Step 3- run the program on the CMD/Terminal

Step 4- Have fun!
